To my Coworkers, I've linked some playlists/music/background noise I like listening to as I work, maybe you'll like it, too, I find it makes
me more productive:

<ul>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlp6aawXVoY">All-around solid choice, if not a little plain</em></li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHqw900CuTY">Studying with Gandalf/em></li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl9OmHy6c6o">The Presidential Pump (this one's kinda goofy)/em></li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk">Lofi Girl, a classic</em></li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p77-glF--GA">I don't even watch anime, but this is pretty good</em></li>
</ul>
